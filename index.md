## About Me

I am a Linguistics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley. I have a BA in Linguistics and minor in Chinese Language from Princeton University.

## Research Interests

- **Psycholinguistics:** morphological decomposition, non-compositionality, idiomaticity, semantic opacity, compounds
- **Computational Linguistics:** corpus linguistics, communicative efficiency, vector semantics
- **Syntax:** hierarchy effects, Agree, case marking
- **Other:** Mandarin Chinese, writing systems

## Current Projects

### Ditransitive Object Marking in Tamang
- Investigating how various syntactic theories of Agree can explain an unusual pattern of ditransitive object marking in Tamang, a Sino-Tibetan language spoken in Nepal. 
- Intersects with current discussion in the field about case assignment by Agree and hierarchy effects within case systems. 
- Data for this project has been generously provided by consultant Aki Tamang through the UC Berkeley Advanced Language Documentation and Description course.

### Decomposition of Semantically Opaque Morphemes and Pseudomorphemes in Chinese
- Provides experimental support for the obligatory decomposition model of morphological processing. 
- Primarily studies the psycholinguistic processing of two semantically unusual phenomena in Chinese: archaic idioms (成语 *chengyu*) and loanword-based pseudocompounds. 
- Results of a priming study on native Chinese speakers indicate that archaic idioms are morphologically decomposed during processing in spite of their semantic opacity and archaic syntactic irregularity, supporting the obligatory decomposition model; ambiguous results on loan word pseudocompounds indicates the need for further study.

### Predicting Chinese Idiom Memorability and Obscurity from Linguistic Features
- Prior reserach on principles of communicative efficiency in natural language have primarily focused on high-frequency words; this project extends those findings to low-frequency fixed expressions such as idioms.
- Comparing efficiency-based linguistic features of archaic Chinese idioms (成语 *chengyu*) that have either remained in common usage or fallen into obscurity. 
- Preliminary results indicate that idioms which are simpler and more consistent with Modern Chinese syntax are more likely to be retained in the vocabulary, which is consistent with principles of communicative efficiency.

## Other Interests
When not studying Linguistics, I also enjoy practicing Taekwondo, knitting, Chinese calligraphy, and rock climbing.
