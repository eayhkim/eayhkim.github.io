## About Me

I am a Linguistics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley. I have a BA in Linguistics and minor in Chinese Language from Princeton University.

## Research Interests

- **Psycholinguistics:** morphological decomposition, non-compositionality, idiomaticity, semantic opacity, compounds
- **Computational Linguistics:** corpus linguistics, communicative efficiency, vector semantics
- **Syntax:** hierarchy effects, Agree, case marking
- **Other:** Mandarin Chinese, writing systems

## Current Projects

### Ditransitive Object Marking in Tamang
I am investigating how various syntactic theories of Agree can explain an unusual pattern of ditransitive object marking in Tamang, a Sino-Tibetan language spoken in Nepal. An object case marker appears on direct objects in monotransitives, or on indirect objects in ditransitives, but never appears on both indirect and direct objects simultaneously; furthermore, indirect and direct objects appear sensitive to an animacy hierarchy. The project is relevant to current discussion in the field about case assignment by Agree and hierarchy effects within case systems. Data for this project has been generously provided by consultant Aki Tamang through the UC Berkeley Advanced Language Documentation course.

### Decomposition of Semantically Opaque Morphemes and Pseudomorphemes in Chinese
Experimental studies have found support for the obligatory decomposition model of morphological processing. However, it is disputed how decomposition proceeds a) cross-linguistically and b) for lexical items that fall on the spectrum of semantic opacity/irregularity. I address both aspects of this research gap through a priming study on two semantically unusual phenomena in Chinese: archaic idioms (成语 *chengyu*) and loanword-based pseudocompounds. The presence of priming effects on archaic idioms indicates that they are morphologically decomposed during processing in spite of their semantic opacity and archaic syntactic irregularity, supporting the obligatory decomposition model; ambiguous results on loan word pseudocompounds indicates the need for further study.

### Predicting Chinese Idiom Memorability and Obscurity from Linguistic Features
This project aims to understand if general principles of communicative efficiency that have been found to act upon high-frequency words in natural language vocabularies cross-linguistically also extend to low-frequency fixed expressions such as idioms. I use corpus frequency statistics, word vector semantics, and ngram language models to comparing the linguistic features of archaic Chinese idioms (成语 *chengyu*) that have either remained in common usage or fallen into obscurity. I demonstrate that idioms which are simpler and more consistent with Modern Chinese syntax are more likely to be retained in the vocabulary, which is consistent with principles of communicative efficiency.

## Other Interests
When not studying Linguistics, I also enjoy practicing Taekwondo, knitting, Chinese calligraphy, and rock climbing.
